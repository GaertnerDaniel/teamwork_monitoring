### Date: 12th December 2019 Kick-off! :airplane: :rocket:  

#### Agenda  

*Presentation of the supervision team: Daniel, Lorelei and Matthieu  


*Presenting the PhD project:
  +Objectives of the project:  
  :arrow_right: 3 big questions around the tropical tuna fisheries under FADs: :one: effects of FADs on high seas populations, communities & ecosystems, :two: efficiency of moratorias in Atlantic ocean and :three: we don't know what Fisheries Functionnal Zones (FFZ or ZFH) are for yellowfin (YFT), skipjack (SKPJ) and Big Eye (BET) tunas.  
  
  :arrow_right: This project aims to answer these questions in 4 steps:  
  
  :one:Use AOTTP (mark-recapture program in AO) data to evaluate the efficiency of current and past moratorias (2 periods x 2 zones)  
  :two:Defining ZFH for BET, YFT + SKJ in AO and IO using size and species structured, spatialized and time referenced (aggrgated 1°/month) landings data  :fish:  and define. A second part of this objective will be to link these data with environmental data (chl a, Temp, currents, sea height anomaly...)  
  :three:Assess the temporal and spatial evolution of ZFH, the connectivity between them and find if these zones are relevant for bycatch species as sharks  :shark:  
  :four: Use the knowledge acquired on ZFH to evalutate the moratorias and propose new type of moratorium based on adapted spatio-temporal strata
